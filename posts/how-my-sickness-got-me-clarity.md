title: How a Sickness Gave Me a Career Reality Check
date: August 02, 2025

So, I got malaria.

And honestly, it was a wild ride.

The fever was intense, and I was seeing things.

I'm still feeling a bit off, with a weird taste in my mouth, but I'm slowly getting back to normal.

The sickness hit at the end of July. I guess I was due for a break. For the past thirteen days straight, I'd been working like crazy on my project, [Waveroom] — a platform where music lovers can share their thoughts and playlists. Coding, designing, trying to make the right decisions... it was a lot.

As a final-year physics student, I’ve got a lot on my plate. I'm terrified of failing, but I also want a good future. So, I’ve been burning the candle at both ends, trying to be a good student and build my career as a software designer.

The pressure is all on me.

I've never been one for the spotlight, and maybe I probably never will be. I just really enjoy building things (and getting paid to do it).

The little sickness, in all its hallucinatory glory, forced me to recalibrate my entire approach to life and work. Here’s what it taught me:

** 1. Iterate Fast, Learn Slowly **

It's good to move quickly on new ideas, but it's more important to take the time to really understand what's working and what's not, both in my work and in my life.

** 2. Your Body is Your Vessel, Trim It **

Forget the "work 'til you drop" mentality. My vessel, it turns out, is not an indestructible spaceship. It needs fuel, rest, and a serious debriefing from a doctor. Ignoring its needs is a one-way ticket to a forced system reboot.

** 3. You Are Not Your Mistake **

Making mistakes isn't the end of the world. It’s just a chance to fix things and get better.

** 4. Catch Every Moment as a Learning Moment **

Every single thing that happens, good or bad, is a lesson. I need to pay attention and learn from it..

** 5. Build Meaningful Relationships **

You can’t do everything alone. The people in your life—family, friends, mentors—are the most important support system you can have.

I wish I could elaborate further on these newfound truths, but my brain's CPU is still running on low power mode. For now, please enjoy this small dose of my "mind juice" and consider it a testament to the strange and wonderful clarity that a good old-fashioned fever can bring.

**Talk to you all soon. Ciao.**
